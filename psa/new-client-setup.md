## Gather Client Information

1. **Basic Info**: Client name, primary contact, address, and any pertinent billing details.  
2. **Project Scope**: High-level description of services to be provided (e.g., “Ongoing Support,” “Implementation Project,” etc.).  
3. **Billing Preference**: Are they invoiced monthly, quarterly, or upon project milestones?

## Create Client Record

1. Navigate to **Clients** in the PSA sidebar.  
2. Click **New Client**.  
3. Enter the **Client Name**, address, and any relevant notes or tags.  
4. Select the **Owner** (the main point of contact on our team).  
5. Click **Save** to finalize client creation.

## Project & Contract Setup

1. Go to **Projects** or **Contracts** within the PSA tool.  
2. Click **New Project** (or **New Contract**) and associate it with the newly created client.  
3. Set up **time estimates**, **budget**, and **billing rates** (if applicable).  
4. Assign **team members** who will work on the project.  
5. (Optional) Add **milestones** or **deliverables** with due dates.

## User Access & Permissions

If the client will access certain PSA features (like ticketing, dashboards, or project status):

1. In the **Admin** settings, select **User Management**.  
2. Click **Invite New User**.  
3. Enter the client’s email address and assign **Client**-level permissions.  
4. (Optional) Enable or disable specific modules they can view (e.g., **Project Progress**, **Invoices**).

## Verification & Handoff

1. Confirm all data (client info, project details, billing methods) is correct.  
2. Do a quick **test** invoice or **time entry** to ensure the configuration is accurate.  
3. Communicate **login details** to the client if they have user access.  
4. Document any **special requests** in the client’s notes.

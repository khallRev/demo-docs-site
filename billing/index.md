## Billing Overview

We use a centralized billing system that integrates with our PSA platform to generate invoices, track client payments, and reconcile financial data. Consistency in invoice creation and delivery ensures clients receive accurate billing statements.

## Invoice Creation Process

1. **Data Collection**: Pulling time entries, project fees, and any fixed-cost items from the PSA system.  
2. **Invoice Template**: Ensuring the correct invoice template is used for each client or project.  
3. **Approval Workflow**: Invoices are routed for internal approval before being sent to clients.  

## Payment Methods

- **Credit Card**  
- **Bank Transfer**  
- **Check** (where applicable)

Ensure each payment is logged properly in the billing system and cross-referenced with the PSA for revenue reporting.

## Dispute Resolution

In the event a client disputes a charge:
1. **Log the Dispute** in our support system.  
2. **Review Billing Details** in the PSA for accuracy.  
3. **Communication** with the client to clarify discrepancies or errors.  
4. **Adjust or Re-invoice** if the dispute is confirmed valid.

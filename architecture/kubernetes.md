# Kubernetes

Kubernetes (often referred to as K8s) is our primary container orchestration platform. It automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Key Components
- **Pods**: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, typically containing one or more containers.  
- **Services**: Define how Pods are exposed internally (ClusterIP) or externally (LoadBalancer).  
- **Deployments**: Manage desired states for Pods and automatically handle rolling updates and rollbacks.  
- **Ingress**: Routes external HTTP/S traffic to services within the cluster.  

## Our Kubernetes Setup
- **Cluster Provisioning**: We use a managed Kubernetes service (like EKS, AKS, or GKE) for simpler node management.  
- **Namespace Strategy**: Each environment (dev, staging, prod) has its own namespace to isolate resources.  
- **CI/CD Integration**: Deployments are automated via a continuous integration pipeline, ensuring consistent and reliable updates.

## Best Practices
1. **Resource Requests & Limits**: Define CPU/memory reservations to avoid overcommitting cluster resources.  
2. **Security**: Implement RBAC for access control, and use network policies to restrict Pod communication.  
3. **Monitoring**: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for cluster metrics and alerting.
